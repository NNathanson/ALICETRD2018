\begin_layout Subsection
Reading from raw data files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Low level classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The basic classes used to read the raw data files generated by the trdbox
 server were provided by Jan Albert's 20?? Honours project report [ref].
 The two python classes o32reader and adcarray work together to provide
 the basic interface.
 The constructor of o32reader takes in a path to a single data file which
 may or may not contain zero-suppression.
 The o32reader is iterable and as such can be used to loop through individual
 events in a datafile.
 Then using an instance of the adcarray class, one may use adcarray.analyse_event
 to convert a single event as provided by o32reader to a numpy array.
 The resulting numpy array may be accessed via the attribute adcarray.data.
 There are however a couple quirks which must be considered.
 First of all, the trdbox is designed to be able to output data from up
 to 16 pad rows however the detector present at UCT only has 12 pad rows.
 So it is recommended that the first step after analysing an event is to
 slice adcarray.data from 0 to 12 in the first axis and only dealing with
 this subarray.
 Second, the first event after configuring the chamber is always a special
 event known as a 'configuration event'.
 Instead of outputing ADC data, the chamber will simply return the configuration
 register values for each ADC unit.
 Therefore it is recommended that the first event of any data file is disregarde
d in case it happens to be the first event after a configuration.
 Third, when using zero-suppression, there is a 10-15% chance that a given
 event is incorrectly written to the datafile.
 This occurs if the time between two events is not long enough to allow
 the electronics to output their payload.
 When analysing such an event, adcarray will throw a datafmt_error which
 the user should use to skip over the current event.
 Finally, with the current setup, the two ROB boards which lay in the centre
 of the x-dimension are very vulnerable to voltage sag which renders their
 data useless.
 One may recognise this if the data contains hundreds of ADC values around
 522.
 The way to deal with this is to simply apply a mask which sets all values
 corrosponding to the problematic ROBs to 0.
 Due to consistant bad behevaiour from these ROBs (the two in the detector
 and the one Lees :p, remove all this), the middle two ROBs were masked
 to 0 in all the results in section ????.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Initial processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aforementioned o32reader and adcarray classes provide an interface to
 read the raw data files produced by the trdbox; however this process is
 relatively slow and forces any program using the data to engage with a
 complicated reading procedure which may include undesireable events.
 As such it is recommended that the resulting adcarray.data numpy arrays
 are filtered and stored using numpy.save so that the they may be recalled
 much more quickly by other programs using numpy.load.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the scope of this project, a script named interesting_event_extractor
 was created for this purpose.
 The main premise was to define a data_is_interesting function which would
 classify an event as 'interesting' or not.
 Then once any other pre-processing is complete, the resulting array would
 be saved to a directory for later use.
 The critera used for an event to be 'interesting' was simply for it to
 contain a single ADC value above a given threshold (the value used in this
 report was 
\begin_inset Formula $300$
\end_inset

.
 Further explination given in section ????) and for all values above a certain
 threshold (taken to be 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

) to lay in a single pad row.
 This ensured that only events which contained a high energy interaction
 that occured prodiminently in one single pad row would be accepted.
 The reason for the single pad row critereon was that the pad columns are
 much more tightly packed and therefore the detector has a much higher spatial
 resolution in the pad column direction.
 Many assumptions used in the analysis may break down when considering tracklets
 which cross over pad rows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results and data analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The various scripts used in this project may be broadly classified into
 2 catagories, those which are used to validate the contents of a data file
 and those which assume valid data and perform higher level functions on
 this data.
 We will first take a look at the diagnosis tools which in general will
 inspect raw data files and help the user assess whether the chamber setup
 is conduce to valid data.
 Then we will look at some higher level programs which will use the output
 of interesting_event_extractor to make various inferences about the events
 which took place in the chamber.
\end_layout

Diagnosis tools

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Background noise of the TRD
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first test of the chamber would be to sample the output of the detector
 with randomly triggered events.
 With this mode of operation it is unlikely that a given event has captured
 the path of a muon and thus such events can be used to measure the baseline
 value and influence of noise on the pads.
 This will give an indication that all the pads are functioning correctly
 and any pads with an abnormal baseline or level of noise can be isolated
 and investigated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we will inspect the baseline values of a run containing ????? randomly
 triggered events with an anode voltage of 
\begin_inset Formula $1500\text{V}$
\end_inset

 and a drift voltage of 
\begin_inset Formula $-1400\text{V}$
\end_inset

.
 The mean value of a pad was calculated across all events and time bins
 and the standard deviation of each pad was calculated in the same way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figures ?? a) and b) reveal the baseline value and standard deviation of
 each pad.
 There is no clear relationship between the position of a pad and its baseline
 value in plot a), however plot b) demonstrates that there is a source of
 noise in certain regions of the TRD which are likely due to the readout
 electronics which sit on top of the chamber approximately above the affected
 zones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure ?? and table ?? reveal that the observed baseline value accross all
 pads agrees with the specifications outlined in the TRD technical design
 report [ref] which hovers around 
\begin_inset Formula $9.6$
\end_inset

 with a standard deviation of 
\begin_inset Formula $5.3\times10^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
ADC spectrum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next test of the chamber involves taking a histogram of all ADC values
 across many events so that any high energy anomalies can be found and investiga
ted.
 Once triggering has been implemented, this process may be used as an initial
 test to see that the incidence of high-energy interactions increases.
 This may indicate that the triggering process has been correctly implemented.

 was chosen for the interesting_event_extractor as described in section

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Time bin sum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once triggering yields reasonable results as per the previous tests, one
 may want to begin identifying which events and which data files may contain
 actual muon tracks.
 One useful test for this is to take a histogram of the sum of the ADC values
 across the time bins (also reffered to as a tb-sum) for one or more events.
 The utility of this is that the ADC spectrum is vulnerable to localized
 high energy spots which one would not anticipate if an event is to capture
 the entire path of a muon.
 On the other hand, a high tb-sum value indicates that a pad saw activity
 across multiple time values.
 This likely corrosponds to a muon track in the region of the given pad.

Higher level investigations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the triggering was correctly configured and the captured data passed
 all initial tests, all relevant raw data files were passed through the
 interesting_event_extractor and the following features were investigated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Linear fits to event data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having captured the track of a muon, one very useful property one might
 extract from such an event is the ray which the muon took through the detector.
 This report took a simplified approach to determining the approximate track
 of muon by taking a weighted linear fit of the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 components of the track as a function of distance travelled through the
 detector and only considered ADC values with a value greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

.
 The ADC value (with baseline subtracted) of each point was taken to be
 its weighting in the fit and the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 component of a point was assumed to be a linear function of the time bin
 to which it belongs.
 This is a reasonable assumption to make since the drift velocity of the
 electrons in the gas is approximately constant in the drift region and
 therefore the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-position of a ADC value is approximately linear in the time bin value.
 However taking the weight of a point in the fit to be its ADC value will
 tend to be disproportionately biased towards points which were slightly
 closer to a muon's true position than other points.
 Nevertheless this assumption still worked well as a first approximation.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure ?? demonstrates the output of such a fit and Table ?? provides the
 fit parameters through index space of the pads.
 As expected, the ray is aligned in the y-direction (it lays in one pad
 row) and it is evident that the influence of the ray reaches accross multiple
 pad columns in a single time-slice.
 The long faint tails below the uppermost points demonstrate how a tail
 of noise can follow a legitimate measurement from a padwhich is likely
 due to internal capacitance and other electrical affects.
 This affect was not accounted for in this report.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pulse height spectrum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm for determining the linear fit parameters can be used to produce
 what is known as the pulse height spectrum for the detector and its configurati
ons.
 The pulse height spectrum is designed to give insight into the rate at
 which electrons approach the pads as a function of drift time.
 The first step in producing a pulse height spectrum is to take an event
 and produce the linear fit for the track.
 Then by taking the average ADC value in a neighbourhood around the track
 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-direction for each time slice (keep in mind that we are selecting for 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-aligned tracks), we obtain an approximation of the intensity of the track
 at each time slice.
 Then by averaging the intensity at each time slice accross many events
 we obtain the pulse height spectrum of the detector and its configurations.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure ?? shows a pulse height spectrum for the detector.
 There are various components to this plot which contain interesting information.
 For a generic single track, the leading peak is caused by the collection
 of electrons which were produced in the anode zone and are subsequently
 absorbed all at once, resulting in a spike.
 The proceeding plateau corrosponds to the consistent trickle of electrons
 from the drift zone into the anode zone.
 Ideally one would hope to see a perfectly horizontal plateau which would
 imply homogenous electron production as a function of distance, constant
 drift velocity and no loss of electrons due to re-absorbtion as the drift
 towards the pads.
 However with the current detector setup there appears to be a loss of intensity
 with increasing distance, which is likely due to impurities in the gas
 which absorb the ionization electrons as they drift.
 Notice however that we may extract the drift velocity of the electrons
 from the pulse height spectrum since the width of the plateau corrosponds
 to the time taken for the last electrons to drift from the bottom of the
 detector to the pads at the top.
 Since we know how far up the pads are situated, we may calculate the speed
 at which the electrons drift.
 Although this calculation is not performed in this report, it is key to
 recognise this connection.

\begin_layout Standard
One further relationship one may want to verify is the impact of the drift
 and anode voltages on the pulse height spectrum.
 Figure ?? demonstrates how increasing the drift voltage has the effect
 of increasing drift speed, since the plateau shortens, but also a small
 increase in height which means keeps the integral under the curve constant.
 This is to be expected since the drift voltage does not affect the gain
 of the detector and so the total number of electrons which reach the pads
 is constant (which is correlated with the ADC value) .
 Varying the anode voltage on the other hand does not change the width of
 the plateau but does affect the amplification of the electrons and thus
 increases the net area underneath the graph as shown in Figure ??.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Angular Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the pulse height spectra obtained in section ?.?.?, one can infer how
 the time bin of an ADC value relates to the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-component of where the electrons that induce its potential were originally
 deposited.
 For a drift velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $1400\text{V}$
\end_inset

 we may read off Figure ?? that it takes approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $11$
\end_inset

 time bins for the electrons to move from the bottom of the detector to
 the top.
 Then using the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-dimension of the detector as described in the technical design report [ref],
 we may infer that the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

'th time bin corrosponds to approximately a depth of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{i-5}{11}*0.036\text{m}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, using the pad spacings from the technical design report, we may
 calculate the inclination angle of a given track.
 This is how the inclination angle of the sample track in section ?.?.? was
 calculated.
 This is of course a rough calculation which ought to be made with more
 care and uncertainty analysis in the future.

\begin_layout Standard
The final property of the detector explored in this report was the position
 resolution in the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-direction of the detector within a single time slice.
 As a first order approximation, the position of a muon in a given time
 slice was approximated as the centre of 'mass' of a neighboorhood around
 where the linear fit crosses the time-slice which included approximately
 4 pads to either side of the fit point.
 The mass of a point was simply taken to be its ADC value once the baseline
 has been subtracted.
 The value of the centre of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-coordinate was then compared to the value of the linear fit 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-coordinate which was taken to be a far more accurate measure of the true
 position of the muon in that time slice.

\begin_layout Standard
Table ?? gives the best fit parameters for the Gaussian and tells us that
 the position resolution of the detector is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $0.16\text{cm}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $0.22$
\end_inset

 in pad width units) with a systematic bias which cannot be discerned from
 
\begin_inset Formula $0$

 at the given resolution.

Conclusion for the TRD component of the report
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary goal of the TRD component of this report was to provide a technical
 report on how to configure and run UCT's TRD detector.
 Thanks to the extensive help of Prof.
 Dietel, the TRD was succesfully setup and valid data was captured.
 The outline provided in the preceeding pages will provide any future students
 with a solid footing on which to build their own projects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The addition of the HiSPARK detector and its integration with the TRD provided
 the required triggering mechanism to consistently catch muons with nearly
 every event.
 Although some further trigger mechanisms should be considered in the future
 to increase the effective angular acceptance and reduce the probability
 of false triggers resulting from noise in a single detector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tools developed in section ?.?.? will give any future projects a headstart
 in the diagnosis of issues with the TRD and its configuration
